### Answer the following Questions first:

1. Using create-react-app, what do we need to set up for testing?
    Setup configurations for jest testing environment. This will depend on the type of tests that we would like to do whether unit or integration
2. What components are worth to test in your development?
    - Components that handle some logic on the front end
    - Components with user events such as user actions and action creators
    - Components that have sensitive data flows that can break your app
3. Can you apply TDD once you already created components?
    - Yes. You can use TDD if part of your originally written code is failing. Create a hypothesis of the outcome, match the requirement then write the test then create the functionality.
